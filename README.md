# discussion-forum
A simple discussion forum made in PHP and JavaScript, using a MySQL db

Literally no security focus whatsoever as this was a school project and thus provided little time, requiring me to prioritize the actual server/front-end functionality over security.
Uses an XAMPP apache server with a MySQL database for storing user details, forum posts etc.
